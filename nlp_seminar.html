    <h1>Columbia University NLP Seminar</h1>
    <p>The seminar is a series of both invited faculty talks and student speakers. All are welcome to attend. <br>The standard time is <strong>10:00-11:00am ET on Tuesday</strong> <span style="color:red">(new time this semester)</span>. <br>The seminar is <strong>hybrid</strong>: both in-person and over Zoom. In-person presentations will be in the CS conference room. The Zoom link will be sent out to the NLP mailing list.

    Upcoming Talk: Tuesday Nov. 2, Marianna Apidianaki</span>

	<p class="card-text"><span class="subtitle">Abstract: </span>The linguistic and world knowledge encoded in the representations of pre-trained language models is currently under intense scrutiny. Information about structure-related linguistic aspects (word order, grammar and syntax) and the meaning of word instances is accessible in token-level representations. In this talk, I will present a set of experiments that address two aspects of lexical semantics traditionally studied at the level of word types: lexical polysemy and intensity. I will show that it is possible to identify these types of information using simple vector operations and calculations in the vector space built by contextual models. The results of intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations suggest that intensity information is present in words' contextualized representations in different languages. Furthermore, experiments conducted following a rigorous protocol proper to lexical semantic analysis show that contextual models acquire rich knowledge about words' polysemous nature during training which they combine with information from new contexts of use.</p>
	<p class="card-text"><span class="subtitle">Bio: </span>Marianna Apidianaki is a Senior Research Investigator in the Department of Computer and Information Science (CIS) at the University of Pennsylvania, on leave from her tenured position in the French National Research Center (CNRS). From 2019 to 2021, she worked as a Senior Researcher in the Language Technology lab at the University of Helsinki (Finland). In 2016 and 2017, while still at the CNRS, she was a Visiting Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania. Marianna received her PhD in Linguistics in 2008 from University Paris 7. Her research topics are lexical semantics and natural language understanding. Her work has been published at leading *ACL conferences and journals. She has been Area Chair for Lexical Semantics in seven *ACL conferences in the past two years, and is currently Action Editor for ARR. She was Program Chair for the *SEM 2020 Conference and Area Chair for Multilinguality at *SEM 2019. From 2017 to 2019, she chaired the International SemEval competition and the corresponding workshop. Since 2019, she is one of the organisers of the DeeLIO (Deep Learning Inside Out) workshop.</p>
